Wikipedia is a free, web-based encyclopedia that is written and edited by volunteers from around the world. It is one of the largest and most popular general reference works on the internet. Here are some key points about Wikipedia:

FUNCTION:
A home page is the primary web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors. In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.

Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website; for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
